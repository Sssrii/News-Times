Issue:
The project works properly on VS Code's Live Server, but the API does not fetch data when deployed on GitHub Pages. This issue is likely due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions or HTTPS-related problems with the API requests.

Short Description:
This project is a news aggregation website that fetches breaking news from various categories like general, sports, business, and technology using NewsAPI. It dynamically displays news articles with images, titles, and descriptions. While it works perfectly locally, it faces issues fetching data on GitHub Pages, possibly due to CORS or HTTPS problems.
